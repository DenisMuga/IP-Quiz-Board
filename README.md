##Description
The aim of this project is to create a QUIZ BOARD using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript concepts. The project ensures best user experience by ensuring that students can answer various multiple choice questions and get their scores after the application computes their final score. Besides the QUIZ BOARD alerts the students by letting them know whether they have passed excellently, fairly, or poorly depending on their score percentages. A poor score below 50% alerts students to retake the test. The project is primarly designed for desktops.
